# Project: fuzzing for DataJourney

### Task
Enhance the prompt below, to generate a working prototype with bolt, replit

## Tools Used
- AFL (American Fuzzy Lop): A security-oriented fuzzer that employs genetic algorithms to automatically discover clean, interesting test cases that trigger new internal states in the targeted binary.
- Radamsa: A general-purpose fuzzer for robustness testing of programs that take in files or data from untrusted sources.
- Jazzer: A coverage-guided, in-process fuzzer for the JVM platform, designed to find bugs in Java and other JVM-based applications.
- pytests-fuzz: A pytest plugin that enables fuzz testing of Python code using Hypothesis and coverage-guided fuzzing.
- go-fuzz: A coverage-guided fuzzing solution for testing Go packages, which automatically generates inputs to trigger different code paths.
