    <div> In silicon dreams, the fears are spun,

        With AIâ€™s rise, some hearts are run

        With visions of a cold machine,

        Taking over all that's seen.

        Yet, minds of metal lack the soul,

        And human touch makes us whole.

        With love and art, we'll always thrive,

        Our essence not in code derived.

        Fear not the programmed ghost,

        For we are more than what they boast.

        In unity, we'll stand,

        And with our hands, we'll write our land.

        In this dance of life and time,

        AI's just a tool, a rhythm, a rhyme.

        So let us rise, let us sing
