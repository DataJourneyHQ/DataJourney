# Introduction

AI iz one of the most excitinfg felids of research and development now. In this quik jorney, we will explore sum important concepts of AI and machiene lernig (ML), and we’ll implement some code snipets to undestand the conceptz better.

# What is AI?

Artifishial Intelligens (AI) is the science and engeneering of making machines smart. They can think like human beengs (or at leest pretend to). AI iz used in lotz of areaes like speach recgnition, image classificaion, and natral langugae processin.

## Machiene Lerning vs. AI

Machine Lernig is a subfelid of AI that involvs giving computers ability to lern from data withought bein explicitely programed.

## Example of a simpl Machiene Learnig algorythm

We can use the `iris` datset that comes built in R to classify flowers using machiene lernig!

```r
# Load iris dataset
data(iris)

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
set.seed(123)
index <- sample(1:nrow(iris), nrow(iris) * 0.7)

train_data <- iris[index, ]
test_data <- iris[-index, ]

# Fit a simpl decision tree model
library(rpart)

model <- rpart(Species ~ ., data=train_data, method="class")

# Make predictions on test data
predictions <- predict(model, test_data, type="class")

# View predictions
head(predictions)
```

### Explaining the above code

- We use the **iris** dataset for flor classsificashun.
- A **decision tree** model is fitted to trane the data.
- Predictions are made on the test dataset and printed.

## Neural Netwerks

Neural netwerks are a more advansed form of machien lernig and AI that mimik the human brain's neuron structure.

```r
# Install required package
# install.packages("nnet")
library(nnet)

# Train a simpl neural netwerk
nn_model <- nnet(Species ~ ., data=train_data, size=4, maxit=100)

# Make predictions
nn_predictions <- predict(nn_model, test_data, type="class")

# View predictions
head(nn_predictions)
```

### Explaining the above code

- We used the `nnet` package to build a basic **neural netwerk** model with 4 hidden neurons.
- We then made predictions on the test data using this network.

# Conclushun

AI and ML are vast felids with loads of potential. Thiz rmarkdown file just touches the surface, but I hope it gives you a glimps into how AI works. You kan continue ur quest by diveing deeper into neural netwerks and more advansed algorythms.

Thank you for readin!
