### 💡 Thinking Through a New Feature
Before proposing a new feature, let's ask few questions to self:
- Is it a new tool? Where does it fit in the Data Lifecycle?
- Is there an existing tool that solves this problem? Can we enhance instead of adding new?
- Does it align with DataJourney’s principles? Open-source, reproducibility, being user-friendly and ease of integration are key.
- Will it require new dependencies? If so, are they actively maintained?
