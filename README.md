### Environment setup using conda:

#### Installing miniconda
- Visit : https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

#### Create a conda environment
```shell
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
```shell
conda activate journey
```

#### Install the package locally
```shell
pip install -e .
```

#### ðŸ”Œ About pre-commit-hooks and activating
Just like the name suggests, pre-commit-hooks are designed to format the code based on PEP standards before committing. [More details ðŸ—’](https://pre-commit.com/)

```shell
pre-commit install
```
#### How to run the applications?

- Dagster UI app
