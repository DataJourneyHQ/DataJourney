### üöå DataJourney

#### ü™∂Short version

Design- first Open Source Data Management Toolkit. Simplifies data workflows with modular, reproducible solutions

#### üå≤Long version

DataJourney demonstrates how organizations can effectively manage and utilize data by harnessing the power of open-source technologies. It's designed to help navigate the complex landscape of data tools, offering a structured approach to building **scalable**, and **reproducible** data workflows.

Built on open-source principles, the framework guides users through essential steps‚Äîfrom **identifying** goals and **selecting tools** to **testing** and **customising** workflows. With its flexible, modular design, DataJourney can be tailored to individual needs, making it an invaluable toolkit for data professionals.

### üö¶ Hold on, looking to contribute?

Head over to the [wiki](https://github.com/DataJourneyHQ/DataJourney/wiki/Contribute-to-DataJourney), let's make it happen together. We don't bite :)


### üß± Design Philosophy (LEGO)
Built with additive, subtractive capabilities glued with open source.
Each layer has a certain strength of communication inbuilt

- PO (Base): Static home(s) to keep it together `(GitHub)`
- P1 (Tooling): Tooling, strings `(Powered by open source)`
- P2 (Maintenance + Monitoring): Env, automations `(Pixi + GHA)`
- P3 (Abstraction): Layer(s), CLI/task manager for users to interact with `(Pixi)`
