### Environment setup using conda:

#### Installing miniconda
- Visit : https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

#### Create a conda environment
```shell
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
```shell
conda activate journey
```

#### Install the package locally
```shell
pip install -e .
```

#### ðŸ”Œ About pre-commit-hooks and activating
Just like the name suggests, pre-commit-hooks are designed to format the code based on PEP standards before committing. [More details ðŸ—’](https://pre-commit.com/)

```shell
pre-commit install
```
#### How to run the applications?

- Dagster UI app
```shell
cd analytics_framework/pipeline
```
```shell
dagit -f process.py
```

- Panel app
```shell
cd analytics_framework/dashboard
```
```shell
python simple_app.py
```

- Mito

Before running the jupyter notebook `doc/mito_exp.ipynb`, run the below command
in your terminal to enable the installer. Might take some time to run.

To explore further visit [trymito.io](https://docs.trymito.io/)
```shell
python -m mitoinstaller install
```
